This is my portfolio on Japan for the Tourism Page Project.

I focused on providing travel inspiration through creating a gallery of three different cities in Japan. For this page (gallery.html), I wanted to try create a masonry gallery, but I found it difficult on how to make it responsive and make the cards even from the top. 

For the getting there page, I showcased transportation options in Japan in general.
